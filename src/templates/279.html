		<p><component src="icon-edition.html"></component><strong>Hi</strong>, Chris here with&nbsp;your weekly update on all things Nintendo. Hope you're doing well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This week Nintendo dated&nbsp;a couple of things: <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles 3&nbsp;and Splatoon 3</strong>. Xenoblade has been moved up to July, and Splatoon has been dated for September. The release date news was accompanited by new trailers â€” <em>both of which are linked in the issue below</em>.</p>
		<p>Now, the Splatoon 3 trailer got me thinking: Other than being more of the same (<em>which can often be a good thing!</em>) what is it about this new version that's got you hyped? <a href="https://example.com">This tweet thread from Kate WillÃ¦rt</a> asked a similar question. Hit reply to this email&nbsp;if you want to share any thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Anyway, next week we have&nbsp;<strong>15&nbsp;games</strong>&nbsp;hitting the Switch, including Nintendo Switch Sports and The Stanley Parable. Full list below for you to check out.</p>
		<p>Finally, I'm around 10 subs away from <a href="https://switchweekly.com">hitting my next YouTube sub count goal</a> â€” if you're not subbed already, I'd love for you to hit the button and follow along. ðŸ˜Š</p>
		<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
